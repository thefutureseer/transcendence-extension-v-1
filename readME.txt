Google Chrome extension called, "Call God, transcendence extention" 
that adds a button to the browser's user interface (UI). The extension 
is aimed at anyone with faith and will allow them to call out to God. 
When the user clicks the button, it will trigger a message to be sent 
to the heavens. The user can also manually input their message, which 
will be saved to the browser. The extension's UI will have a minimalist 
theme and will be available only in English. The extension will have a 
timer with one preset time of 1 minute and the ability for the user to 
set a custom time. The 'on' button will be green, and the 'off' button 
will be red. When the user types a message, only the first few words 
will be displayed, and the rest will be hidden until the user clicks 
on the message area. The placeholder text will read "Write anything 
as you know God is watching." The extension will display "God Knows"
when the timer ends. The extension will be developed using JavaScript 
and the following third-party libraries are used: jQuery, Bootstrap, 
and Font Awesome. Security and privacy features will be implemented to 
protect the user's data, although no login is required for the first 
version.
